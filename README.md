### What is the 'Wall of Awesome'? How do I do it?

- This is a special tradition in the pods community
- Each site member can give a 'star' to another member in the portal and write a post about what they did to go above and beyond that was awesome, for example, say Jake washed all the dishes in the sink even though they werent theirs. Then Alice writes on the 'wall of awesome' a short comment about this, and Jake gets a star.
- Stars are displayed on their profile
- They are a fun way to build reputation and have an interactive experience with the community that brings attention and appreciation to those that are doing selfless things
- Each site member can give up to 1 star per week to any other site member. A comment is required. Editing or deleting of accolades is only possible by the admin.


### What are Community Managers?

- A Site may have a community manager, usually if it is larger, above 15 people.
- The responsibilities for the community manager can vary, but often they include:
    - restocking the communal supplies using the shared bank account (if the site has one)
    - being the laison between the site members and the site admin
    - organizing community self organization for example with town hall meetings, taking notes, and writing public articles on the Site blog.


### What's with the icons?

- Each new site member is assigned an 'icon'
- The icon is displayed on your profile page under your Site Membership
- Each icon is tied to a pod, and other private spaces like the closet and kitchen cabinet space
- When you join a site you pick a pod and your icon is entered in the platform. When you move out, that icon becomes free and then it is clear which space belongs to which person.
